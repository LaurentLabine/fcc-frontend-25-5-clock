# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Project 5 - Build a 25 + 5 Clock

See the result here: https://laurentlabine.github.io/fcc-javascript-calculator/

I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Responsive Web Design.

## Technologies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It is built using the React Library coupled to Styled-Component's global styles along with eslint and prettier extensions for code formatting.

It answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock with the tests that can be run from the page itself.

## Possible Improvements?

Future possible improvements could include implementing using React Hooks as well as adding a media request and a different layout for smaller screens or differently formatted screens.
